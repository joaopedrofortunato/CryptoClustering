#### Answer the following question: 

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:** Using fewer features in K-Means clustering saves time, aids visualization, and reduces noise. However, in this case in specific, it may have led to information loss and lower cluster quality.
